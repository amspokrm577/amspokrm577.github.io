1. What did you like about this website?
    - the initial homepage was very impressive, elegant, and helpful when trying to understand
    what kind of website this was.
    - The background images staying static as the content as the content scroll was a really cool
    feature. That combined with the stock-information scrolling across the top made the site
    seem very modern. I do wish there was a way to pause or stop the the scrolling so I could
    actually read it though. Perhaps a simple [ while hover -> stop scroll ] would have worked
    perfectly for this.
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    - The significant difference between my site and this one is its target audience. This site
    seems to be providing a service to the general public. Giving them information about stocks
    and a stock comapny. Whereas my site is focused on providing information on an individual
    to specific people.
    a. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        - I think my site has a better user experience for two reasons. First, the colors on
        this site have a very high contrast and although it makes it easy to read, it makes
        it very hard to look at. I would recommend a high contrast for the font but softer
        and more complimentary colors for the webpage's color scheme. Second, when viewing
        this site on a mobile (or smaller) viewing port, a lot of the images become warped
        and the text often bleeds off the page.
    b. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        - I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "maintainable." Under the assumption that it
        means it can be modified easier in the future, or expanded upon. I don't think either
        is particularly better than the other. Looking through this site it seems to have a
        lot of layers which is good. It allows divs and things to be modified at different
        levels.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    a. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    - I would say the code is not well structured or organized at all, unfortunately. However,
    This is a simple fix. I would start by putting my .css and .js file(s) into their own
    respective folders. From there I might rename all my files such that the naming scheme
    is consistent. Either with camel case or some other naming scheme. It seems like most
    things are, but "Home.html" is still capitalized.
4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    a. were semantically appropriate elements selected
        - Yes, as far as I found.
    b. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
        - The CSS file contains most of the style used throughout the webpage. The only
        style tags I was able to find were things that modified a single specific line,
        such as an h1. This is good css practice.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    - The colors and image warping were the biggest issues I had with the user experience.
    Otherwise, you had useful information presented in an efficient manner. Try using the
    dev tools and reducing your website's resolution to something around 400x400 and see
    if you can avoid the images warping or the text falling off the page, otherwise
    aweomse site!
